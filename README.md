# CubeSat Project

## Design Software
- **Fusion 360**

## Material Selection
- **Aluminium Alloys**

## Analysis Software
- **ANSYS Workbench**

## Project Components

### Design
- CAD model of CubeSat created in Fusion 360.
- Includes all structural components, mounting points, and payload housing.

### Material Selection
- Materials were chosen based on criteria such as thermal properties, strength-to-weight ratio, etc.
- List of materials used for different parts of the CubeSat.

### ANSYS Analysis

#### Thermal Analysis
- Simulation of thermal loads to ensure the CubeSat can withstand space conditions.
- Results indicate temperature distribution and thermal stresses.

#### Modal Analysis
- Performed to assess the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the CubeSat.
- Ensures structural integrity against vibrational loads during launch.

#### Static Structural Analysis
- Analysis under static loads to evaluate stress distribution and deformation.
- Ensures that the CubeSat can endure the forces during launch and in orbit.
